Future Enhancements

	•	Implement more granular permissions for collaborators (e.g., read-only access).
	•	Enhance the commenting system with email notifications.
	•	Optimize performance for large documents.
	•	Add support for real-time editing of images and other media.
	•	Integrate user profiles with avatars.

Additional Notes

Security Considerations

	•	Ensure DEBUG is set to False in production.
	•	Properly configure ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py.
	•	Keep sensitive information out of version control (e.g., secret keys).
	•	Use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit.

Scaling the Application

	•	Use a production-ready web server like Gunicorn for HTTP requests.
	•	Deploy behind a reverse proxy like Nginx.
	•	Implement load balancing to handle increased traffic.
	•	Consider using a cloud-based Redis service for better performance and reliability.

Testing

	•	Write unit tests using Django’s testing framework.
	•	Run tests with:

python manage.py test


	•	Ensure code coverage is adequate.
